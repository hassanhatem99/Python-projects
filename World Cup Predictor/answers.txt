Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Spain and Portugal winning it, as they never
get the number 1 spot when it's 1000 simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 simulations, because it's the most consistent
with Brazil or Belgium getting the win
